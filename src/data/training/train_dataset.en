The free Adobe Photoshop Express app provides photo magic at your fingertips. 
Join millions of creative folks who trust and use Adobe Photoshop Express for fast, powerful, and easy editing. 
This is the one-stop shop for your quick and fabulous photo editing needs.
Use Adobe Photoshop Express to create better looking pictures. 
Use slide bar adjustments or automatic one-touch fixes to achieve great results. 
If you’re new to the app, here are few ways to improve your photos:
INTRODUCING NEW LOOKS AND BORDERS:
CREATIVE LOOKS:
* Now choose from more than 45 eye-catching effects called Looks! 
Control the intensity of Looks with a simple slider. 
Different categories of Looks like Black and White, Portrait, Nature, Pop Color, and Duo Tones help to get you the right effect to apply.
BORDERS:
* Use our newly added Borders to add a distinctive personal touch to your photos with 30+ borders and frames. 
Express yourself!
EDIT PHOTOS:
* Quickly open photos from the device.
* Snap pictures from right within the app.
* Edit photos to their possible best. 
An easy to use interface provides seamless switching between various edits.
* The comprehensive photo editor allows you to polish your photos so that you can turn your imagination to reality.
CROP:
* Fix photos fast — crop, straighten, rotate clockwise and anticlockwise, flip horizontal and vertical.
* Crop also provides easy one-touch default aspect ratios.
CORRECTIONS:
Make your photos pop with simple sliders:
* Control and set contrast, clarity, saturation, vibrance, dehaze
Use these controls in your photos to produce stunning results. 
Contrast is an attention-grabbing control that can turn your ordinary photo into a dazzling masterpiece.
Adjust the color saturation using the Vibrance and Saturation controls.
Adjust clarity slider to reveal more texture and detail in your photos.
Use the Dehaze slider to add or remove haze from your photo.
* Exposure, highlights, shadows, blacks and whites
You can fine-tune the photo’s exposure setting using the Exposure adjustment controls. 
Highlights and Shadows are the best way to optimize your photo’s exposure in highlights, midtones, and shadows, without compromising on other areas of tonality.
Use Blacks and Whites to set black point and white point of the photo. 
This makes colors appear completely black or white.
* Temperature and Tint
Use Temperature and Tint controls to introduce warmth or coldness to your photo. 
You can also control the amount of green and red tones in your photo.
Use the Temperature slider controls to increase or decrease the amount of orange or blue tone. 
Increasing the amount of orange introduces warmth to your photo. 
Increasing the amount of blue introduces coldness to your photo.
Use the Tint slider control to add more red or green tone to your photo. 
Auto White-Balance does this automatically for you.
* Details
Use Sharpen, Reduce Luminance Noise, and Reduce Color Noise to make photos look more beautiful and minimize unwanted grain and speckling in your photos.
* Split Tone
Stylize your photos through color tints in the highlights and shadows.
* Blur
Use the Blur effect to give your images an enhanced, surreal effect.
* Fade
Blend images with the background using the new “Fade” effect and give a matte feel to your photos.
*Vignette Effect
Add a sentimental feeling or evoke nostalgia to your images using the Vignette effect.
* Removing spots or blemishes have never been so easy! 
Remove pimples, scars, dirt and dust from your photos with one touch.
REMOVE RED EYE AND FIX PET EYE:
* Just a tap is required to remove red-eye of people or pets in photos.
You can use the Red Eye tool to reduce the red eyes in the subjects of your photo. 
This desaturates the red pixels within the target area and reduces the effect.
AUTO FIX: 
* Edit your photos with a one-touch auto adjustment.
RAW PHOTO SUPPORT:
*Photoshop Express supports the following file formats:
• Photo: 
JPG, PNG
• Raw files: arw (SONY), cr2 (CANON), crw (CANON), dng, erf (EPSON), raf (FUJI), 3fr and fff (HASSELBLAD), dcr (KODAK), mrw (KONICA), mos (LEAF), rwl (LEICA), nef and nrw (NIKON), orf (OLYMPUS), rw2 (PANASONIC), pef (PENTAX), srw (SAMSUNG.

That depends on what type of file you’re trying to ingest.
You can install Photoshop and other Creative Cloud apps on up to two computers.
You may need to update Adobe Camera Raw, the plug-in Photoshop uses to import raw image files.
Check the Creative Cloud desktop app to see if an update is available.
You might need to optimize your operating system, your hardware, or your Photoshop setup.
Photoshop uses the Adobe Camera Raw plug-in to import and enhance raw images from many different cameras.
Older versions of Photoshop were not designed or tested on current operating systems.
Yes, you can have multiple versions of Photoshop installed on your computer at the same time.
You can create a motion tween animation three ways.
New to motion tween animation?
The ActionScript scripting language lets you add complex interactivity, playback control, and data display to your application.
You can install extensions as add-ons, through the Manage Extensions utility, or using the command line.
Get started with Adobe After Effects.
You can install After Effects and other Creative Cloud apps on up to two computers.
Use the Warp Stabilizer VFX effect to automatically stabilize shaky or jerky shots.
Realistic motion is more than simply moving an object.
You mask an object so that other footage can appear within it.
Why is my video file so huge?
When you render and export a movie, the default settings create uncompressed or losslessly compressed files.
Such files are huge and intended for post-production work, not playback.
For smooth playback on your computer, compress the file.
Use Adobe Media Encoder to export to these formats.
Use Adobe Media Encoder to export to H.264 (.mp4), the format recommended by the Adobe Flash team.
QuickTime includes a preference for encoding legacy codecs.
If the setting is not enabled, some codecs will not be available in After Effects.
Problems with QuickTime can have many sources.
You installed a language version of After Effects that does not match the operating system language.
Bridge crashes if you are using earlier versions of Mac OS X El Capitan with specific external display settings.
You can install InDesign and other Creative Cloud apps on up to two computers.
Use the Place command to insert graphics into an InDesign document.
A range of issues at the document or system level could prevent you from printing or exporting a document as PDF.
These lines are caused by export issues, such as process and spot colors interacting during flattening.
This issue is typically caused by placing large images and then scaling them down significantly.
If your InDesign preferences become corrupted, you can see some strange behavior.
This prevents Premiere Pro from locking up while you export.
A few factors could be triggering this behavior.
You can make this change when you purchase a subscription.

If you're using another browser, ensure that it supports TLS 1.2.
Your operating system and application frameworks must also support TLS 1.2. If upgrading your browser does not resolve your problem, ensure that your computer meets the following system requirements:

It is deployed widely for web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network.
The Handshake protocol enables the server and client to authenticate each other, and negotiate encryption algorithms and cryptographic keys before data exchange.
However, older versions of these browsers or OS are not updated to include the latest standards.
As the acceptable level of security rises, these older, less secure browser versions and applications are left behind.
To be able to connect with secure sites, update your OS and browser versions.
There have been documented attacks against TLS 1.0 using an older encryption method and the older versions are more vulnerable than TLS 1.2. For more information, see 
PCI adaptation server is a set of security standards require organizations that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information to maintain a secure environment.

Our standard collection includes photos, video, illustrations, and vector imagery. 
The royalty rate is applied to the net price per licensed asset, based on the U.S. purchase price and including any discounts. 
For example, if the plan costs US$29.99 per month for 10 monthly photo licenses, then the royalty amount (rounded up to the nearest cent) would be US$0.99 per licensed photo (US$29.99 / 10 photos x 33%). 
Note: actual royalty calculations may not be rounded to the nearest cent.
Adobe Stock also licenses assets through custom agreements and non-standard plans, such as Creative Cloud Express plans and Pro Edition plans for Creative Cloud for teams and enterprise. 
Royalty rates for assets licensed under these agreements and plans are either: (A) for non-video assets, 33% of the attributable amount, and for video content, 35% of the attributable amount; or (B) a flat rate. 
While the keywords will appear in alphabetical order in Lightroom Classic, they will revert to the order you added them when you upload your images to Adobe Stock. 
Don't forget, you must list your keywords in order of relevance to maximize search optimization.
