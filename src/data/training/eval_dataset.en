Upcoming system requirements changes for our video and audio apps
This includes the 23.0 versions of Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, Character Animator, and Media Encoder.
New Minimum OS Requirements
Windows users must be on Windows 10 (64-bit) v20H2 (or later) or Windows 11.
We recommend running our applications on the latest operating systems:
Windows 10 (64-bit) v21H2 or Windows 11
It will not be possible to install the 23.0 versions of our video applications on macOS 10.15 or older.
Upcoming GPU support changes
CUDA graphics
You'll need current NVIDIA drivers to use the next major release versions of our video applications with CUDA.
Discontinuing support for NVIDIA Kepler series GPUs
NVIDIA discontinued support for Kepler-series Quadro 
NVIDIA Kepler graphics cards include Quadro K series GPUs (see links above), 
If you install Premiere Pro with an unsupported GPU, Premiere Pro will still run, but rendering will be software-only, slowing down performance.

Update to
Intel® Graphics Driver for Windows 7*/8.1* [15.36]
Intel® Graphics Driver for Windows* [15.40]
Intel® Graphics Driver for Windows* [15.45]

Upcoming system requirements changes for Adobe video and audio apps
We will update our system requirements with the next major release of our video applications.
New minimum OS requirements
Starting with version 24.0 of our applications, Mac users will need to run macOS Monterey (version 12) or later. 
Windows users must be on Windows 10 (64-bit) version 22H2 (or later) or Windows 11.
We recommend running our applications to be used on the latest operating systems:
macOS Ventura (version 13).
Windows 10 (64-bit) version 22H2 or Windows 11 version 22H2.
Installing the 24.0 versions of our video applications on macOS 11.0 or older will not be possible.
Mac users can continue to use the 24.0 version on Apple silicon and Intel-based Mac.
New processor requirements
The 24.0 versions of our video applications will require processors with Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2)
On Mac, the 24.0 versions will not install on Mac Pro 2013 or older systems.
The 24.x versions of Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Media Encoder will not run on CUDA graphics without current NVIDIA drivers (522.25 or later).
Starting in late 2023, 24.x versions of Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Media Encoder will no longer support NVIDIA Kepler series graphics cards. 
NVIDIA Kepler graphics cards include Quadro K series GPUs (view links above), some 
If you install the application on machines with an unsupported GPU card or drivers, the app will still run, but rendering will be software-only, slowing down performance.
